          Lemme start with why like when we have streamlit jus why cause streamlit apps looks shit like literal piece of shit,
          you’d argue we ain’t no web devs our role is to show that how our model works well yea but beauty with brain is the best combo.
          I ain’t saying that build from scratch im just saying that you can build it in at max 2 days a sexy premium next js shit
          that will easily make your project stand out ofc with vibe coding but knowing how things work & trust me its easy af.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now is it even worth it i would say it is like its good cause this is not that hard & full stack ai eng roles are quite in trend
          which basically builds complete applications by integrating traditional software development (front-end, back-end, databases, APIs)
          with artificial intelligence, machine learning (ML), and large language models (LLMs) to create intelligent, user-ready products from scratch.

    the only stack you actually need

        <p>
          How much time would it take i would say if you follow what i say it would take just 1-2 month at max to cover HTML, CSS, JS then react & next.js
          now react needs some extras like a database called as MongoDB & Node and express.js.
          This tech stack is called as the famous MERN stack which is pretty easy trust me,
          while the next alone can handle backend & frontend but since it is built upon react you need the basics of react.
        </p>

        <p>
          This all might sound overwhelming but it is not you know whats the hardest thing i consider is :
          its to fcking fix the ui but thanks to the agents this process is easy as well,
          just store a good prompt that worked for someone & that’ll design the basic blueprint on top of whic h we can build upon.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here is a website i built in just 2 days
          <a href="https://archepapers.playground.veritus.jp/" class="text-orange-600 underline">
            https://archepapers.playground.veritus.jp/
          </a>
          so trust me & follow what i say.

          Ok so how to do it quick & how to develop a website even more quick.
          First things first tech stack will be simple & industry standard of next js & typescript or react js
          now for those who don’t know shit abt web dev next js is for frontend means what is visible on screen
          & typescript is basically a safety check similar to pydantic i would say
          means if you say a variable is integer then you can’t assign it a string kind of thing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here is a list of things or order i want you to follow to learn this with resources shared & also what not to do -
        </p>

        <p class="text-center text-xl font-mono">
          HTML → CSS → JS → MERN → Next js
        </p>

        <p>
          By doing this you will get the pattern of how things work & later you will start to use the latest stack
          like tailwind css instead of vanilla css & trust all of this is not hard at all
          you just need to build two or three full stack projects & you’re done
          cause what is it just api calls, data fetch from backend & showing in frontend.
        </p>
